# TreehouseBadge
new initialize


This project takes json data (source data can be found at www.teamtreehouse.com/dawson89.json) and runs in a console application. 

You will need Visual Code Studio to run this console application.
Download the source files and run the solution in VS. Run the program application. The program allows you to select the number of bades you would like to view. How many you would like to like to edit. And the number of badges you would like to include in a new export file. The application persists any changes made from your previous interation.
